how will you access the password stored in Key Vault and use it as Admin Password in the VM ARM template?

First we need to click on Azure Key vault service, there in new keys have been created with secret values which we can see there. Also, there is an option to create new link service by which key secrets have been connected to resources. We can select the provisioned Azure Key Vault where your key secrets are saved and can do test connection to make sure Azure Key Vault connection is working or not.
